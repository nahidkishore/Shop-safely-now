## Shop safely now

 A single page e-commerce website (using Context API), where the user can see the details of any product and add it to the product cart.In the product details section, if the user wants, he can decrease and increase the quantity of the product. In the cart section, if the user wants, he can add multiple products, increase, decrease, and remove the quantity of the product. This is a fully responsive site. Created this project using Context API and React(i have already done another e-commerce project specially shopping cart using Redux ). I will add the payment gateway system and user authentication system in a few days.
